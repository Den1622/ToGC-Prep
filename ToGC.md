# ToGC Preparation - Team Darklions
## All Raiders must read


As you are all aware, our first ToGC raid is tomorrow night, starting at 7:30PM Server Time. 

Before we start I just wanted to set some expectations around preparedness for the raid and secondly loot distribution. 
It is expected that you have a base knowledge of the fights, and whilst we may not get capes the first week, our priority is to be farming capes. **ASAP**

## Raid Assignments and tools to succeeed

Please watch the Joardee guides listed here, I know they are long but they are going to go a long way in helping you understand the encounter. 
Try and watch what is happening on the screen rather than just listening, it will help you pick up on various nuances.

Our Raid Assignments are as follows, please go through all the tabs at a first glance and see where you fit in so there are no surprises.
[Sheet: This will be kept up to date week to week and is where you will find the roster](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12ewyA8AGRln-gefoQ0yVON2NqEot_Ns2ju5_Sz8EHTQ/edit#gid=0)

## WEAKAURAS / Macros (MUST HAVE)
- [Tems ToGC](https://wago.io/TemsToGC) - We all know how useful this tool is, please have it working alongside DBM.
- [Fojii Penetrating Cold](https://wago.io/gTmTzXIa-) - Everyone please download, 5 penetrating cold debuffs will go out at a time on Anub'arak. This addon puts a number on the debuff that correlates with the assignments on the spreadsheet, under custom options please set your numbers healers.

### Health Reduction Macro - Anub'arak last phase (ALL HEALERS AND DPS (TANKS DO NOT USE YOU MAY DIE))
Because Anub'arak does 30% Current Health % Leech, the less health you have the less he leeches overall, tanks keep all stam buffs

## Notable Loot Decisions 

### Trophies of the Crusade
All raiders this phase will be given 3 Trophies from 25 man in a staggered fashion, they will be rolled and we will keep track of how many trophies you all have. 
The upside to this is that you can also get 4 Trophies a week in your 10 man groups so please keep us updated on how many trophies you have acquired. 

The overall idea is that each player will get 3 Trophies and 1 Regalia piece until everyone has one, and then we reset for 2pc Regalia etc.

This is to make the phase a bit more fair in terms of loot distribution, mainly because we already meet the difficult dps checks required for every boss first week and the fact that tier set bonuses can be acquired in 10 man Heroic with badges.

### Capes
Capes are going to be loot councilled based on high performers in the phase and people that follow the mechanics and assignments.
Please note that itemisation is much better in ToGC so although you may not get a cape straight away, there are 5 variants and they will be less contested than items in ulduar.

You will only ever get 1 cape, unless you are a designated off-healer or tank. (Steveoh in this case is the guilds 3rd tank if needed, and will be given a tank cape once the other 2 tanks have it for example.)

### Death's Choice / Comet's Trail

Death's Choice will be prio'd to DK's > Ret > Hunter before any other classes as it is the highest dps gain relative to other trinkets that are also bis for melee this phase for other classes, please see the Sim below.

These classes also keep Death's choice through ICC and don't replace it with DBW. 

Rogue's will be the only prio on Comet's Trail, up for review after they receive them.

### Loot In general

We will be using the published bis lists from Fusion, there are multiple sets for different classes but we will be gearing you up in these sets as it gives us a smoother progression path itemwise through ICC.

### First Week Info (Please Read)

I don't care how long this week takes us, I am not looking for a speedclear first week. 
I want you all to familiarise yourself with the raid and ask any questions that pop up (Nothing is too dumb unless miisaki says it.)
Please focus on mechanics over parses and I can't stress this enough, there is no room for greeding in this raid. If you are halfway through a cast or a proc and you get a mechanic, I want you to move instantly, we have more than enough dps to kill everything in this raid.

I look forward to raiding this phase with you all. 

Cheers
